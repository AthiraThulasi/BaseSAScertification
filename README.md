Welcome to the SAS Base Certification Repository!

Within this repository, you'll discover a wealth of resources that were invaluable during my own preparation for the Base SAS certification exam. Here's a glimpse of what you'll find:

Practice Questions: Dive into 9 sets of practice questions designed to hone your skills and reinforce your understanding of key concepts.

Base SAS Prep Guide: Access the comprehensive BASE SAS preparation guide, meticulously curated to cover all essential topics and equip you with the knowledge needed to excel in the exam.

Dataset Collection: Explore the dataset folder containing datasets referenced in the prep guide. These datasets are essential for hands-on learning and applying theoretical concepts in a practical setting.

To get started, open the "cre8data.sas" program in your preferred SAS environment. In the "Path" macro variable, simply replace "/folders/myfolders" with the path to your "Cert" folder, then execute the program. 

Happy studying and best of luck on your exam!
