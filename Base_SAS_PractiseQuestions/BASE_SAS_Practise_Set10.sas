(Q7) Locate the SHOES data set from the SASHelp library.
The SHOES data set contains data from a giant shoes maker.
The data set contains the following variables:

REGION: the region of operation
PRODUCT: the products of focus
SUBSIDIARY: the sub-region or city of the region
STORES: the number of stores that carry the products
SALES: the sales of the products
INVENTORY: the value of the unsold inventory
RETURNS: the value of the returned merchandise

Task 1:
Calculate the return rate for each product:Rate = Returns รท Sales;

Data shoes;
set sashelp.shoes;
return_rate = Returns / Sales;
run;


*Task 2: Find out the product that shows the highest return rate across all of the regions.
What's the product that has the highest return? What region was it being sold in?;

Proc sort data = shoes out = shoes_sort;
by region return_rate ;
run;

Data shoes1;
set shoes_sort;
if last.return_rate then status = 1;
run;

*Task 3: Create a data set that contains the product that shows the highest return rate in each region.
What's the product that has the highest return rate in Africa?;

Data Shoes;
Set sashelp.shoes;
rate = returns / sales;
arbi = 1; * Arbitrary variable *;
Run;

Proc sort data=shoes;
by rate;
Run;

Data Shoes2;
Set shoes;
by arbi rate;
if last.arbi;
Run;

*Please note that an arbitrary variable is needed when there is no grouping variable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Task3: Create a data set that contains the top two products that show the highest return rate in each subsidiary.
Which two products are returned the most in Bangkok, Asia? - Slipper and Boot are returned the most in Bangkok, Asia;

Data shoes;
set sashelp.shoes;
return_rate = Returns / Sales;
run;

Proc sort data = shoes out = shoes_sorted1;

if first.subsidiary then num=0;
num+1;
if num in (1, 2);
run;

*Task 5: The CEO of the shoe maker is giving out an annual bonus to the regional managers.
The total bonus to be given out will be 5% of the total sales across all region.
Calculate the total bonus to be given out to all regional managers;

Data bonus;
set sashelp.shoes ;
Total_bonus = sales*(1+5/100);
run;


*Task 6: Calculate the percentage contribution from each region to the total sales.
For example, if the total sales is 150 millions, and the Africa sales is 12 millions, the contribution from Africa to the total sales is:
12m / 150m = 8%. Create any date set or variable if needed;
